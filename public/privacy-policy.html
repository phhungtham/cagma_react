      <h3 class="mt-4">Our Commitment to Privacy</h3>
      <p class="mt-2">
        At Shinhan Bank Canada, we are committed to protecting your privacy and maintaining the confidentiality of your
        personal information. This Privacy Policy describes our practices relating to the collection, use and disclosure
        of personal information and is based on the privacy principles set out in the Personal Information Protection
        and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”).
      </p>
      <h3 class="mt-4">What is Personal Information?</h3>
      <p class="mt-2">
        Personal information is information about an identifiable individual, but does not include the name, title,
        business address or telephone number of an employee of an organization. The personal information that we collect
        in the course of doing business may include such things as your name, mailing address, date of birth, financial
        information and credit records. We consider the sensitivity of personal information in deciding how it should be
        collected, used, disclosed and safeguarded.
      </p>
      <h3 class="mt-4">Why We Collect, Use and Disclose Personal Information</h3>
      <p class="mt-2">
        We collect, use and disclose your personal information in order to provide certain financial and related
        services to you. These include:
      </p>
      <ul class="mt-2">
        <li>opening and maintaining your account(s) with us;</li>
        <li>providing you with financial products and services you have requested;</li>
        <li>establishing your identity in order to protect you and us from error and fraud;</li>
        <li>providing related administrative services;</li>
        <li>providing you with information about other products and services that may be of interest to you; and</li>
        <li>complying with legal and regulatory requirements.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="mt-4">How and What Personal Information We Collect</h3>
      <p class="mt-2">
        Most personal information is collected directly from you. With your consent, we may obtain personal information
        from other sources such as credit bureaus. We may also verify personal information you have provided to us with
        other sources. For example, we may verify information you provided regarding your employment with your employer
        or credit-related information with a credit bureau. In certain circumstances, we may collect personal
        information that you had previously provided to one of our affiliates in order to facilitate the provision of
        products and services to you by Shinhan Bank Canada, including determining your creditworthiness. All personal
        information is collected by fair and lawful means.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        Your receipt of different products and services may require the collection of different kinds of personal
        information. We will not collect more than is necessary for the purpose of which it is collected. For example:
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        If you apply for a credit product, we use your financial information to assess your eligibility. Financial
        information may include your tax returns, net worth statements, employment income and credit information.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we verify or update your personal information with a credit bureau, your Social Insurance Number is the
        most effective way of ensuring that we access the correct credit report. Please be aware however, that the
        provision of your Social Insurance Number for this purpose is purely voluntary. Should you choose to not provide
        us with this piece of personal information, we will still be able to perform credit verifications and updates
        with a credit bureau with other personal information for identification.
      </p>
      <h3 class="mt-4">Obtaining Your Consent</h3>
      <p class="mt-2">
        Your knowledge and consent are required before we may collect, use or disclose your personal information, except
        in particular circumstances as required or permitted by law. When you apply for one of our financial products or
        services, we obtain your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in
        accordance with this Privacy Policy. We will not use or disclose your personal information beyond the scope of
        the purposes for which we have obtained your consent without first obtaining your consent to such new use or
        disclosure.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        Subject to legal and contractual requirements, you may withdraw your consent to the collection, use or
        disclosure of personal information at any time. We will respond to any such request in a timely manner. If
        accommodating your request would limit or prevent us from providing you with a product or service you have
        requested, we will explain the implications of your request to you at the time you refuse or withdraw your
        consent.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        We may from time to time contact you in order to provide you with information about additional products and
        services which we feel might be of interest to you. Should you not wish to receive such communications from us,
        you may contact us at the information provided below in order to refuse or withdraw your consent to this use of
        your personal information (see “How to Contact Us”).
      </p>
      <h3 class="mt-4">Limiting Use and Disclosure of Your Personal Information</h3>
      <p class="mt-2">
        We will not use or disclose your personal information for purposes other than those described in this Privacy
        Policy or of which we informed you at the time of its collection, unless we obtain your prior consent to such
        use or disclosure or unless such use or disclosure is required or permitted by law.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        As indicated above, we may disclose the personal information you have provided to us for verification purposes,
        including, depending on the circumstances, to your employer, to a credit bureau, or to any of our affiliated
        institutions, including those located in other jurisdictions.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        Shinhan Bank Canada may retain carefully selected third parties to perform functions or to provide services in
        support of the products and services Shinhan Bank Canada provides (for example, printing cheque books). When
        transferring personal information to a third party service provider, we transfer only that personal information
        which is required in order to perform the function or service for which the third party has been retained. All
        third parties to whom we transfer personal information are required to protect that information in accordance
        with this Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        To the extent that any of our affiliates or any of the third party service providers we retain are located
        outside of Canada, personal information transferred to them will be subject to the laws of the foreign
        jurisdiction where they are located, including those laws governing disclosure of personal information.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        In the event of a sale of some or all of our business, your personal information may be disclosed to an
        acquiring organization, either as part of due diligence and/or on completion of the transaction. If your
        personal information is disclosed to a third party in this context, we will require that the third party agree
        to treat your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        In certain circumstances, we may disclose your personal information without your knowledge or consent, as
        required or permitted by law. This may occur if we are compelled to disclose personal information to a
        regulatory or law enforcement authority or to a court of law. We are also permitted to disclose certain personal
        information in order to collect on an overdue account, or as required to detect or prevent fraud.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        Upon receipt of a written request, we will provide you with reasonable access to personal information about you
        that is in our possession. We will also update and/or correct your personal information as required. If you have
        a sensory disability, we will provide access to your personal information in a requested alternative format as
        required by law.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        In some cases, we may not be able to provide you with access to your personal information, including in the
        following circumstances:
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        if doing so would reasonably be expected to threaten the life or security of another individual;
      </p>
      <p>if disclosure would reveal confidential commercial information;</p>
      <p>if the personal information is protected by solicitor-client privilege; or</p>
      <p>
        if the information was collected during the investigation of a legal matter or for purposes related to the
        detection and prevention of fraud.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-2">
        If we are unable to provide you with access to your personal information, we will advise you in writing of the
        reason(s) for the refusal, unless we are prohibited from doing so by law.
      </p>
